# aframe_follow
A basic a-frame component to have an object follow the camera without being part of the UI. 

Useful for adding a "menu" or other elements that can follow the player around in larger WebVR experiences.

By using a follow function like this, instead of adding something to the UI, you can have still use the gaze to click. 

Big thanks to @dmarcos for helping me get the tick function working.
